# bulk_find_replace

An R script that does a find and replace in bulk. The output will be similar to a case-insenstive "find and replace" in Excel, with "match entire cell contents" checked.

Put your data that you want to bulk find/replace in data/spreadsheet_to_update.xlsx. Some sample data is in there already. Replace as necessary.

Put your find/replace text into data/replacements.xlsx. Use the sample data as a guide.
